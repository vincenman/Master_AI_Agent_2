# ## OpenAI Hosted Tools
# 
# OpenAI Agents SDK includes the following hosted tools:
# 
# The `WebSearchTool` lets an agent search the web.  
# The `FileSearchTool` allows retrieving information from your OpenAI Vector Stores.  
# The `ComputerTool` allows automating computer use tasks like taking screenshots and clicking.
# 
# ### Important note - API charge of WebSearchTool
# 
# This is costing me 2.5 cents per call for OpenAI WebSearchTool. That can add up to $2-$3 for the next 2 labs. We'll use free and low cost Search tools with other platforms, so feel free to skip running this if the cost is a concern. Also student Christian W. pointed out that OpenAI can sometimes charge for multiple searches for a single call, so it could sometimes cost more than 2.5 cents per call.
# 
# Costs are here: https://platform.openai.com/docs/pricing#web-search

words. Capture the main points. Write succintly, no need to have complete sentences or good \
grammar. This will be consumed by someone synthesizing a report, so it's vital you capture the \
essence and ignore any fluff. Do not include any additional commentary other than the summary itself."
