"""The QA tester: the ADK orchestrator plays its team's games to judge them.

Equipped with the Playwright MCP browser server, a single ADK agent opens each
finished game, plays it, watches the console, and reports which work and which are
broken. This is the capstone's lesson in miniature: give an agent a goal and a way
to check its own success, here a real browser, and let it evaluate the work itself.
The agent's verdicts drive the one bounded fix round.

The browser comes through the Playwright MCP server (npx @playwright/mcp) driving
the system Chrome, the same kind of browser-over-MCP the Sidekick used in Week 4.
If the MCP server or Chrome is unavailable, we fall back to a plain file check and
still open the finished site.
